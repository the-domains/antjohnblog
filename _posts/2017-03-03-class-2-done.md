Class \#2 done!

It was a bit slow going for my second class at The Tech Academy. The overview of software development course gave me the understanding that my ability to learn and adapt will be valuable in the software development process. It seems curiosity is also coming in as a strength. I want to know more about the programming languages and the syntax needed to properly write algorithms. The libraries of code available for each language are also of interest. Objects, properties, and behaviors. I have an idea for all that information. When working for the manufacturing plant, I found joy using advanced excel formulas and techniques, creating macros and looking at the code. My confidence is growing as I continue down this learning path.

I am a third of the way through my third class, Version Control. The concepts are familiar, as I worked in a large manufacturing plant where many engineers update many part drawings. The systems that worked to maintain a flow of document versions was easy for me to understand and appreciate. I am sure there will be similarities in the process for code version control.

I've been applying for work. I am hoping I can find a company that is willing to grow with me. This new knowledge will be incredibly helpful in the software development industry.
