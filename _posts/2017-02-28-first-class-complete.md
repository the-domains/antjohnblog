**First Class Complete**

I successfully completed my first class at The Tech Academy. It was computer basics and I was fairly confident in my knowledge. The learning provided a deeper understanding to some subjects, which I appreciated. Binary is rather fascinating. I liked dropping into the command shell of Windows 10 Pro (running in Parallels 11 on my Late 2013 15" MBPr) to show my mastery of the DIR command. So nostalgic of DOS 6.22 on my first 80286 pc. Swoon.

Moving into the overview of software development course, I had a slow start. A busy week hustlin' to earn some dough took a toll on my time available for homework. Learning some more binary functions tonight, which is cool. I think I can get the hang of this. Half way through! I appreciate the mix of media to learn from in the class structure. Touching on flow charting was a great throwback to my days working at the manufacturing plant. I took a flow charting class that was offered through the internal training offerings. That is one thing I appreciate about that company.

Oh... a little while back I did some work for my friend, Mark. He's the owner of Kilroy's Tattoo in SE Portland. In gratitude, I am being blessed with a full sleeve. I cannot recommend him highly enough. Follow this link to see the progress on the tattoo: http://tiny.cc/KilroysTattooBear
