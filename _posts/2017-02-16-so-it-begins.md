**So it begins...**

I've come to a place in my life where I must dive head first into a new industry.

When I received my first computer as a lad of twelve, I fell in love with technology. Over the course of the last 26 years, computers have been an everyday device. Along with that user experience came advanced knowledge of computer hardware and software, with little tiny bits of coding thrown in when I was still a youth. I did not pursue technology as a course of study while at community college in 1996\. I chose music instead.

After two semesters at college, I was out of money so I joined the national guard, opting to become a logistician. I excelled at serving the logistical needs of the units I was assigned to. Soon after joining the military, in 1999, I was hired on at an industrial manufacturing plant. Over the course of my 14 years working for that company, I was deployed three times with the guard (Egypt once, Afghanistan twice). These active duty periods came with a heavy toll. After ten years with the national guard and earning the rank of Sergeant, I left military service. While I struggled with the memories, I maintained my work ethic and was promoted three times to positions of increasing responsibility. It was a difficult time.

In 2010, three years after my experiences at war, I finally felt present in my daily life and began an earnest healing process. There was much counseling, crying, hula hooping, and ecstatic dance. There was also love. I went back to school using my GI bill benefits. I earned a bachelor of business management in 2013 and after leaving the manufacturing plant, I continued on to earn a master of business administration majoring in sustainable business with a concentration in food systems management in 2015\. Since then, I have moved a great deal searching for viable community and did small consulting jobs on the side to make ends meet. I ended up doing a lot of trade. Finding myself with little income, it was time to ask for help.

As I was investigating help through the veteran's administration, I visited the VA's community resource and referral center. There, I was referred to the Easter Seals employment specialists at worksource Oregon. While conferring with an employment specialist, I was referred to the Reboot Northwest folks to see if I qualified for the program. As a disabled veteran, I was at the top of the list qualified to participate. After filling out forms and completing my work to apply to the program, I received full funding for a software developer boot camp.

That brings y'all up to speed as to where I am now. MBA graduate, disabled veteran, and father beginning to learn how to code at 38\. I chose The Tech Academy as my training provider and am happy with their course of study so far. I am two and a half days in and 50% of the way through the first course... which was projected to take 8 days to complete. This makes me feel good and that I am on the right track with this training program. I am looking forward to the next courses and really digging in to the programming languages.

I plan on posting my progress and sharing the things I create.
