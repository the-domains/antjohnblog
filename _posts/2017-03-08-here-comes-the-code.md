**Here comes the code!**

Oooh! I am so excited! I finished up the version control class and am now running headlong into the HTML5/CSS3 coursework. There is a new learning framework for this course that looks rather nice. 

I have some experience with HTML from classes I took well over ten years ago. It will be nice to refresh my understanding and the new concepts introduced since HTML5 was released upon the world wide web. I understand the concepts of CSS and am curious how to use the language. Happy to go into this course with a solid knowledge base from the previous three classes.

If you are interested in a software developer boot camp, I recommend checking out [The Tech Academy][0] today.
